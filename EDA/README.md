# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

This folder contains materials related to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for the **FoodHub Orders Dataset**. The analysis was conducted as part of a data science project, focusing on understanding and visualizing key patterns in the data. Below are the files included in this directory:

### Files

1. **`FDS_Project_LearnerNotebook_FullCode.ipynb`**: 
   - This is a Jupyter Notebook containing the full code for the exploratory data analysis.
   - It includes all the code, visualizations, and explanations for the steps taken to explore and analyze the FoodHub orders dataset.
   
2. **`foodhub_order.csv`**: 
   - This CSV file contains the dataset used for the analysis, which includes various details about food orders placed through the FoodHub platform.

## Analysis Highlights

In this analysis, the following aspects were covered:
- Data cleaning and preparation.
- Descriptive statistics to summarize key features of the dataset.
- Data visualizations to identify trends, distributions, and potential outliers.
- Exploration of relationships between different variables such as order size, customer demographics, and delivery times.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
     ```

2. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open the `FDS_Project_LearnerNotebook_FullCode.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook FDS_Project_LearnerNotebook_FullCode.ipynb
     ```

3. **Dataset**:
   - The notebook uses the `foodhub_order.csv` file, which is included in this folder. Ensure that the file is in the same directory as the notebook when running it.

## Next Steps

This analysis serves as a foundational step for further data modeling and predictive analysis. Future work will include developing machine learning models to predict customer behavior and optimize delivery times.
