# MIT Data Science Course - Exercises Portfolio

## Overview

Welcome to my Data Science exercises portfolio! This repository contains the notebooks and datasets from the exercises I completed as part of the **MIT online Data Science course**. The notebooks showcase my learning progress in various key areas of data science, including data manipulation, visualization, machine learning, and statistical analysis.

Each exercise folder includes a Jupyter Notebook that explores a specific topic, with real-world datasets used to apply the concepts learned in the course.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders by topic, with each folder containing:
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: The code and explanations for each exercise.
- **Datasets**: The data used for the analysis in each exercise (or links to the data if too large to store here).
- **README.md**: A detailed explanation of the objective, methodology, and results of each exercise.


## Key Topics Covered

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing data, duplicates, and inconsistent formats using Python's Pandas library.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating meaningful visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore data patterns.
- **Machine Learning**: Applying basic machine learning models, including linear regression, classification, and clustering.
- **Statistics**: Performing hypothesis testing, calculating descriptive statistics, and analyzing correlations.

## How to Use

If you'd like to explore the notebooks or run the code yourself:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
2. git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
2. Navigate to a folder of interest and open the Jupyter Notebook:
3. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can find a list of dependencies in each notebook or install them with:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Datasets

The datasets used in these exercises are either included in this repository (for smaller files) or linked in the exercise-specific README files if they are too large to store here.

## Next Steps

I will continue adding new exercises as I progress through the course, with future topics including advanced machine learning techniques, deep learning, and data pipelines.
